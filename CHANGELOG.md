## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **M8 — Interfaces (in progress)**: a shared conversational `ChatSession` core
  (multi-turn, memory-aware) and an interactive `chimera chat` REPL — the
  foundation the TUI and messaging gateway will reuse.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-30

First tagged release. The initial build plan (M0–M7) is complete, then hardened
against real provider models. Highlights, by milestone:

### Added
- **M0 — Foundations**: package scaffold, provider-agnostic LLM gateway (LiteLLM),
  config (pydantic-settings), telemetry, and the `chimera` CLI.
- **M1 — Tier 1 & cross-cutting**: native tools (files/shell/http), the ReAct agent
  loop, Tier-1 skills (complete/fix/generate) + skill-context retrieval, MCP client +
  OpenAPI→tool importer, scheduler (crons + event SOPs), migration from Hermes/OpenClaw.
- **M2 — LLM-Fusion engine**: panel → judge → synthesizer, plus a cost-aware router
  (tool turns single-model, deep reasoning fused).
- **M3 — Tier 2 autonomous**: plan → execute → Manager review → verify-or-revert
  (workspace snapshot/restore + command verifier) + experience buffer. *MVP complete.*
- **M4 — Self-evolution v1**: Memory Manager (ADD/UPDATE/DELETE/NOOP dedup), memory-merge
  in migration, learned-skill evolver (propose→test→keep/discard), self-learned crons,
  continuous-evolution benchmark.
- **M5 — Governance kernel**: allow/warn/block/review trust layer, lexical rule set +
  optional semantic judge, static validators (skill/schedule), audit log, governed tools.
- **M6 — Tier 3 multi-agent**: roles, sequential & supervisor crews, MOC message
  consolidation, shared memory, parallel review.
- **M7 — Tier 4 ecosystem**: meta-agent (agents building agents) with tool isolation and
  hidden-test reward-hack detection, change-tempo governance, trajectory collection
  (SFT/DPO export) seeding opt-in model evolution.

### Hardened (post-M7, validated against real OpenRouter models)
- **Tier-2 correctness**: the executable verifier is now authoritative — a strict
  Manager can no longer veto and revert work that already passed verification
  (a data-loss bug found only under live testing). Manager verdict parsing also
  tolerates markdown/preamble.
- **`solve --fuse`** now routes the *plan* through the fusion engine (deep,
  tool-free reasoning); previously the flag was effectively a no-op.
- **Stateful chained benchmark** (`bench --chain`) measuring error propagation.
- **Windows**: CLI forces UTF-8 output so model text never crashes a cp1252 console.
- **Hermetic tests** (no accidental network) + an opt-in live integration smoke test.

### Quality
- 166 tests · `mypy --strict` clean · `ruff` clean · CI across Python 3.11/3.12 +
  opt-in live integration job. Usage guide in `docs/usage.md`.
