## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Vision / image paste**: `Message` now carries images (local paths or URLs,
  base64 data-URL encoded) in the OpenAI/LiteLLM multimodal format; `chimera run
  --image <path|url>` (repeatable) sends them to a vision model. Verified live
  (gemini-2.5-flash read a generated image's colour).
- **Deliverable Mode** (`chimera deliver`): produce a polished, self-contained
  artifact (report/plan/spec, md/txt/html) and write it to a file; `--fuse` for
  higher quality. Verified live.
- **Pet / companion** (`chimera pet`): a persistent virtual companion with stats
  that decay over time (feed/play/rest); deterministic logic, no key needed.

- **M8 — Interfaces (in progress)**: a shared conversational `ChatSession` core
  (multi-turn, memory-aware) and an interactive `chimera chat` REPL — the
  foundation the TUI and messaging gateway will reuse.
- **M8 — EvoClaw stress test**: `chimera/eval/evoclaw.py` runs the same stateful
  chain in two regimes — *naive* (errors propagate) vs *guarded* (externalized
  state + verify-or-revert + retry) — and reports the degradation gap. New
  `chimera evoclaw` CLI runs the A/B against a real model. Tests prove the guard
  resists the propagation that sinks the naive regime.
- **M8 — Right-hand scenario suite**: `chimera/eval/scenarios.py` + `chimera
  scenarios` run an everyday-assistant task set (date/unit conversions, sentiment,
  email extraction, action items, summarization) with deterministic checks. 7/7
  pass live against a real model.
- **M8 — Full-screen TUI** (`chimera tui`, Textual): a scrolling chat log + input
  + status bar over the same `ChatSession`. Blocking model calls run in a thread
  worker so the UI stays responsive. Adds `textual` as a dependency.
- **M8 — Messaging gateway + HTTP server** (`chimera serve`): a `MessageGateway`
  routes each chat to its own `ChatSession` (per-conversation context, shared
  long-term memory); a stdlib HTTP transport exposes `POST /chat` and `GET
  /health`, and a `LocalAdapter` covers in-process use. Discord/Telegram adapters
  plug into the same `on_message` seam next. Verified live (per-chat memory).
- **M8 — Opt-in model evolution** (`chimera evolve`): `solve --collect` logs
  trajectories; `evolve` curates them into SFT/DPO datasets (reward gating, dedup,
  preference margins), reports training readiness, and emits a runnable LoRA recipe
  (train.py + README + requirements). Training stays external/opt-in — never
  automatic. Optional `train` extra for the heavy libs.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-30

First tagged release. The initial build plan (M0–M7) is complete, then hardened
against real provider models. Highlights, by milestone:

### Added
- **M0 — Foundations**: package scaffold, provider-agnostic LLM gateway (LiteLLM),
  config (pydantic-settings), telemetry, and the `chimera` CLI.
- **M1 — Tier 1 & cross-cutting**: native tools (files/shell/http), the ReAct agent
  loop, Tier-1 skills (complete/fix/generate) + skill-context retrieval, MCP client +
  OpenAPI→tool importer, scheduler (crons + event SOPs), migration from Hermes/OpenClaw.
- **M2 — LLM-Fusion engine**: panel → judge → synthesizer, plus a cost-aware router
  (tool turns single-model, deep reasoning fused).
- **M3 — Tier 2 autonomous**: plan → execute → Manager review → verify-or-revert
  (workspace snapshot/restore + command verifier) + experience buffer. *MVP complete.*
- **M4 — Self-evolution v1**: Memory Manager (ADD/UPDATE/DELETE/NOOP dedup), memory-merge
  in migration, learned-skill evolver (propose→test→keep/discard), self-learned crons,
  continuous-evolution benchmark.
- **M5 — Governance kernel**: allow/warn/block/review trust layer, lexical rule set +
  optional semantic judge, static validators (skill/schedule), audit log, governed tools.
- **M6 — Tier 3 multi-agent**: roles, sequential & supervisor crews, MOC message
  consolidation, shared memory, parallel review.
- **M7 — Tier 4 ecosystem**: meta-agent (agents building agents) with tool isolation and
  hidden-test reward-hack detection, change-tempo governance, trajectory collection
  (SFT/DPO export) seeding opt-in model evolution.

### Hardened (post-M7, validated against real OpenRouter models)
- **Tier-2 correctness**: the executable verifier is now authoritative — a strict
  Manager can no longer veto and revert work that already passed verification
  (a data-loss bug found only under live testing). Manager verdict parsing also
  tolerates markdown/preamble.
- **`solve --fuse`** now routes the *plan* through the fusion engine (deep,
  tool-free reasoning); previously the flag was effectively a no-op.
- **Stateful chained benchmark** (`bench --chain`) measuring error propagation.
- **Windows**: CLI forces UTF-8 output so model text never crashes a cp1252 console.
- **Hermetic tests** (no accidental network) + an opt-in live integration smoke test.

### Quality
- 166 tests · `mypy --strict` clean · `ruff` clean · CI across Python 3.11/3.12 +
  opt-in live integration job. Usage guide in `docs/usage.md`.
